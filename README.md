This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


# Branching

This will help to become better structured for creating new branches.

## Legend

| Instance | Branch | Description |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Stable   | stable | Accepts merges from Working and Hotfixes |
| Working  | main | Accepts merges from Features and Hotfixes |
| Features | feature/* | Always branch off HEAD of Working |
| Bugs | bug/* | Always branch off HEAD of Working |
| Hotfix | hotfix/* | Always branch off Stable |

## Main Branches

The main repository will always hold two branches:

- main
- stable

## Supporting Branches

The different types of branches we may use are:

- Feature branches
- Bug branches
- Hotfix branches

### Feature branches

Feature branches are used when developing a new feature.

Naming conventions are `feature/name-of-feature`

The feature branches can only merged into the Working `main` branch.

### Bug branches

TODO: write discription

### Hotfix branches

TODO: write discription

# Commit Massages convention

This will help to become better structured for creating new commit massages.

## Commit Formats

### Default
<pre>
<b><a href="#types">&lt;type&gt;</a></b></font>(<b><a href="#scopes">&lt;optional scope&gt;</a></b>): <b><a href="#subject">&lt;subject&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty separator line</sub>
<b><a href="#body">&lt;optional body&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty separator line</sub>
<b><a href="#footer">&lt;optional footer&gt;</a></b>
</pre>

### Types
* API relevant changes
    * `feat` Commits, that adds a new feature
    * `fix` Commits, that fixes a bug
* `refactor` Commits, that rewrite/restructure your code, however does not change any behaviour
    * `perf` Commits are special `refactor` commits, that improve performance
* `style` Commits, that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* `test` Commits, that add missing tests or correcting existing tests
* `docs` Commits, that affect documentation only
* `build` Commits, that affect build components like build tool, ci pipeline, dependencies, project version, ...
* `ops` Commits, that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery, ...
* `chore` Miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying `.gitignore`

### Scopes
The `scope` provides additional contextual information.
* Is an **optional** part of the format
* Allowed Scopes depends on the specific project
* Don't use issue identifiers as scopes

### Subject
The `subject` contains a succinct description of the change.
* Is a **mandatory** part of the format
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
  * Think of `This commit will <subject>`
* Don't capitalize the first letter
* No dot (.) at the end

### Body
The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
* Is an **optional** part of the format
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* This is the place to mention issue identifiers and their relations

### Footer
The `footer` should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to **reference Issues** that this commit refers to.
* Is an **optional** part of the format
* **optionally** reference an issue by its id.
* **Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGES:` followed by space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

  ```
* ```
  build(release): bump version to 1.0.0
  ```
* ```
  build: update dependencies
  ```
* ```
  refactor: implement calculation method as recursion
